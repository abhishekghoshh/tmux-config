```

```

```
# Log commits after some date (A sample value can be 4th of October, 2020 - "2020-10-04" or keywords such as "yesterday", "last month", etc.)
git log --oneline --after="YYYY-MM-DD"
```

# How to show the commit log as a graph in Git:
# We can use `--graph `to get the commit log to show as a graph. Also,
`--oneline` will limit commit messages to a single line.

git log --graph --oneline

```
# How to show the commit log as a graph of all branches in Git:
# Does the same as the command above, but for all branches.

git log --graph --decorate
```

```
# An overview with reference labels and history graph. One commit per line.
git log --oneline --graph --decorate

# How to check the current commits log of a remote repo in Git
# Commit after commit, Git builds up a log. You can find out the remote repository log by using this command:

git log branchB..branchA
```

```
# show the commits that changed file, even across renames
# Lists version history for a file, including renames
git log --follow [file]

```

```
# List commits that are present on the current branch and not merged into ref. A ref can be a branch name or a tag name.
git log ref .
```

```
# List commit that are present on ref and not merged into current branch.
git log .ref

```

```
# Lists version history for the current branch from certain author
git log --author=[name]
```

```

git blame [file]

```

```
# List operations (e.g. checkouts or commits) made on local repository.
