## Git project initialization
```
# How to initialize a Git repo:
# Everything starts from here. The first step is to initialize a new Git repo locally in your project root. 
# You can do so with the command below

git init


# Create a git-tracked repository inside a new directory
git init [dir_name]
```


## Add a remote repository in Git
```
# Display if the repo is from the remote
git remote

# How to see remote URLs in Git:
# You can see all remote repositories for your local repository with this command:

git remote -v

# This command adds a remote repository to your local repository (just replace `<url_to_remote>` with your remote repo URL).
git remote add <remote> <url_to_remote>
git remote add origin <http or ssh url>


# How to get more info about a remote repo in Git:
# Just replace origin with the name of the remote obtained by running the git remote -v command.

git remote show origin

# Remove a connection to a remote repo called <remote>
git remote rm <remote>

# Rename a remote connection
git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>

# To get the contents of remote branches in Git without automatically merging:
# This lets you update the remote without merging any content into the local branches.
# You can call git merge or git checkout to do the merge.

git remote update
```
