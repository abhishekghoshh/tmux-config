## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects of any scale.</br>
Linus Torvalds, the developer of the Linux kernel, created Git in 2005 to help control the Linux kernel's development.</br>

### What is a Distributed Version Control System?

A distributed version control system is a system that helps you keep track of changes you've made to files in your project.</br>
This change history lives on your local machine and lets you revert to a previous version of your project with ease in case something goes wrong.</br>
Git makes collaboration easy. Everyone on the team can keep a full backup of the repositories they're working on on their local machine. Then, thanks to an external server like BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab, they can safely store the repository in a single place.</br>
This way, different members of the team can copy it locally and everyone has a clear overview of all changes made by the whole team.</br>
Git has many different commands you can use. And I've found that these fifty are the ones I use the most often (and are therefore the most helpful to remember).</br>

### Basic definitions
- **git**: an open source, distributed version-control system
- **GitHub**:  a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories
- **Commit**: a state of the code base. A snapshot of the project you can come back to. A Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA
- **Branch**: A copy of the project used for working in an isolated environment without affecting the main project. a reference to a commit; can have a tracked upstream. A lightweight movable pointer to a commit
- **Local repo or repository**: A local directory containing code and files for the project
- **Remote**: An online version of the local repository hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. A common repository on GitHub that all team member use to exchange their changes
- **Clone**: The act of making a clone or copy of a repository in a new directory. A local version of a repository, including all commits and branches
- **fork**: A copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user
- **Git merge**: The process of combining two branches together
- **pull request**: a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews, comments, integrated tests, and more
- **HEAD**: representing your current working directory, the HEAD pointer can be moved to different branches, tags, or commits
- **Tag**: a reference (standard) or an object (annotated)


### More advanced definitions
- **.gitignore file**: A file that lists other files you want git not to track (e.g. large data folders, private info, and any local files that shouldn't be seen by the public.)
- **Staging area**: a cache that holds changes you want to commit next.
- **Git stash**: another type of cache that holds unwanted changes you may want to come back later
- **Commit ID or hash**: a unique identifier for each commit, used for switching to different save points.
- **HEAD (always capitalized letters)**: a reference name for the latest commit, to save you having to type Commit IDs. HEAD\~n syntax is used to refer to older commits (e.g. HEAD\~2 refers to the second-to-last commit).
- **ssh authentication**: You can access and write data in repositories  on github.com using the ssh(Secure shell protocol). When you connect via ssh, you authenticate using a private key file saved on your local machine.

### What is a Branch?
Branches are special "copies" of the code base which allow you to work on different parts of a project and new features in an isolated environment. Changes made to the files in a branch won't affect the "main branch" which is the main project development channel.</br>

### What is a repository?
A repository or a repo is any location that stores code and the necessary files that allow it to run without errors. A repo can be both local and remote. A local repo is typically a directory on your machine while a remote repo is hosted on servers like GitHub</br>

### A note on cloning
There are two primary methods of cloning a repository - HTTPS syntax and SSH syntax. While SSH cloning is generally considered a bit more secure because you have to use an SSH key for authentication, HTTPS cloning is much simpler and the recommended cloning option by GitHub.</br>

HTTPS : `git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git`</br>
SSH : `git clone git@github.com:user_name/repo_name.git`</br>
